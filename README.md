# Neural Network From Scratch
Creation and training of a neural network from scratch without Tensorflow. Using numpy for linear algebra.
Completed the unfinished course on youtube by implementing a back propagation algorithm. 
Thanks to Samson Zhang on youtube explaining back_prop in its simplest form.
- Improved the back propagation algorithm and reached a 100% accuracy and 0.0004 categorical cross-entropy loss with 100000 iterations on the Spiral Dataset provided in NNFS library.
- Found the most optimal alpha learning rate with Matplotlib
